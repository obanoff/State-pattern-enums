//The implementation using the state pattern is easy to extend to add more functionality. To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the state pattern, try a few of these suggestions:

// 1. Add a reject method that changes the postâ€™s state from PendingReview back to Draft.

// 2. Require two calls to approve before the state can be changed to Published.

// 3. Allow users to add text content only when a post is in the Draft state. Hint: have the state object responsible for what might change about the content but not responsible for modifying the Post.
